# Lingenia

This small flask app allows you to generate individual words for a naming language. The words are generated by selecting common phonemes (or a user selected combination of phonemes), then combining these into syllables and finally combining the syllables into words.

## How to use this app
![Screenshot of the main Lingenia web interface page, showing features outlined below](images/main_page_view.png?raw=true "Main Lingenia web interface page")

Alternatively, you can click on individual phonemes to add them to the list. Selected phonemes (either those generated by entering the number of vowels and consonants or manually selected by the user) will be highlighted in red.

You can download the output phoneme list and the generated words by clicking the 'download' button at the top of the screen. Uploading this file (using the 'upload' button) will return the same phoneme selection so that you can generate more words.

## Running on Windows

To run Lingenia with a development environment on Windows:
1. Clone this repository
2. Ensure that your version of Python has the modules in the 'Requirements' sections below installed (making a Python virtual environment may be helpful).
3. Open Windows cmd
4. Go to the 'Lingenia' folder in the location of the cloned repository (by using the 'change directory' command 'cd', or by opening cmd in the folder location of Lingenia).
5. Start the flask app by entering the following:
'''
set FLASK_APP=lingenia
set FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
'''
6. Open a browser window and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/lingenia

You should see the main Lingenia page as shown above.

## Requirements

Lingenia was constructed using python 3 and requires the following packages:

- Flask 
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Random

## Details and rules for word generation

### Phoneme selection

### Syllable generation

Syllables are generated using the basic construction:

Onset - Nucleus - Coda

There is a random probability (currently 50% true or false, this may be modified to be more realistic in future) for a syllable to have no coda (be an 'open syllable').

The choice of which phoneme to use as each component is governed by sonority rules, which are based on place of articulation:
- Open vowels
- Mid vowels
- Close vowels and semivowels
- Laterals and rhotics
- Nasals
- Fricatives
- Stops

Each level of sonority is mapped to a number. The onset sonority is randomly chosen (such that it is less than the maximum sonority) and the nucleus sonority will be randomly selected so that it is higher than the onset. If a coda is being generated, it will have a sonority lower than the nucleus.

Phonemes with the designated sonority are then selected for each component of the syllable. The final output is a list of the syllable onset, nucleus and (if required) coda in order.

The files containing probabilities of phonemes (both vowels and consontants) are modified from the Phoible database: Moran, Steven & McCloy, Daniel (eds.) 2019., PHOIBLE 2.0., Jena: Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History.
